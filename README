This file, README, describes the contents of every deliverable,	and more specifically how to reproduce the results presented in	the report.

Contents of this zip file:

	 jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project: all the code and test files.

	 jwmh_jiashuoz_bmc.pptx: interim presentation ppt.

	 jwmh_jiashuoz_bmc.pdf: final project report.

	 README: current file.


Code base in jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project:

       Top level client module:
       jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project/tools/BMC.cpp => BMC with normal/incremental mode
       jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project/tools/BMCItp.cpp => BMC with support for generating interpolents and finding proofs

       BMC module (core algorithm implemented in this file):
       jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project/include/horn/BndExpl.hpp

       Z3 support:
       jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project/include/ae/SMTUtils.hpp

       Benchmark test files(smt2):
       jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project/bench_horn/
       jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project/bench_horn_cex/

       We also used functionality provided by other files in /include/ae/ and /include/horn/.


Instructions for reproducing the results:

1. First follow	 the installation instructions in jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project/README.md, which will build required dependencies(LLVM and Z3) and our project.
2. After step 1, a build/ directory will be created in top level directory. The build/ directory contains the executables:
   	 build/tools/bmc
	 build/tools/itp

3. Run the executables from build directory:
       	 ./tools/bmc arg1 arg2 [path_to_test_file]
	 ./tools/itp arg1 arg2 [path_to_test_file]
	 arg1 and arg2 are the lower bound and upper bound for the unrolling steps. Refer to client module's main function for more details.
	 
4. To reproduce the exact results in the report:
         cd to build directory
	 ./tools/bmc 0 5 ../bench_horn/unsatexample.smt2
	 ./tools/bmc 0 5 ../bench_horn/satexample/smt2
	 ./tools/itp 0 5 ../bench_horn/unsatexample.smt2
