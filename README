This README file describes the contents of every deliverable in project.zip
and, more specifically, how to reproduce the results presented in the report.

Contents of project.zip:

  1. jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project/ : All the code and test files
  2. jwmh_jiashuoz_bmc.pptx        : Interim project presentation
  3. jwmh_jiashuoz_bmc.pdf         : Final project report
  4. README                        : Current file

Codebase in jwmh_jiashuoz_cos516_project:

  1. Top-level client module:
     - tools/BMC.cpp    => BMC with normal/incremental mode
     - tools/BMCItp.cpp => BMC with support for generating interpolants and
                           finding proofs

  2. BMC module:
     - include/horn/BndExpl.hpp => Core algorithms implemented in this file

  3. Z3 support module:
     - include/ae/SMTUtils.hpp => Utility class that interfaces with the Z3
                                  SAT/SMT solver

  4. SMT-LIBv2 test files:
     - bench_horn/     => Examples with no counterexample for all k
     - bench_horn_cex/ => Examples with a counterexample for some k

  We also relied on functionality provided by other files in include/ae/ and
  include/horn/.

Instructions for reproducing the results:

  1. Follow the installation instructions in README.md, which will build the
     required dependencies (LLVM, Z3, Boost, GMP) and our project.

  2. A directory build/ will be created in the top-level directory. The build/
     directory contains the executables:
     - build/tools/bmc
     - build/tools/itp

  3. Run the executables from the build/ directory:
     - ./tools/bmc arg1 arg2 <path_to_test_file>
     - ./tools/itp arg1 arg2 <path_to_test_file>
     - Note that arg1 and arg2 are the lower and upper bounds, respectively, for
       k (i.e. the unrolling steps). These arguments are optional and default to
       0 and 1000 if not specified. Refer the client module for more details.

  4. To reproduce the exact results in the report from the build/ directory:
     - ./tools/bmc 0 5 ../bench_horn/unsatexample.smt2
     - ./tools/bmc 0 5 ../bench_horn_cex/satexample.smt2
     - ./tools/itp ../bench_horn/unsatexample.smt2
     - To toggle between normal mode and incremental mode, modify the last
       argument of unrollAndCheck(...) in tools/BMC.cpp between true
       (incremental mode enabled) and false (incremental mode disabled).
     - One can also print the BMC formula for each value of k by uncommenting
       the macro on line 18 of include/horn/BndExpl.cpp.
